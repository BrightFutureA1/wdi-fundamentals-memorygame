    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

    <h3>Its Addictively Fun!</h3>
    <p>This game is a must play! Not only is it fun and addictive but it tests your memory and keeps you constantly thinking and forces memorization. Which is necessary to help prevent/reverse Alzheimer's disease. I received numerous feedback from people around the world who can't believe the changes that occurred since engaging in such a challenging memory game.</p>
